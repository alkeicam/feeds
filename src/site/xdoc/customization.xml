                <p>
                    RSS Feed Creator is easily customized for your own environment. The most common
                    customization will be using your own document type in the RSS feed instead of the
                    provided example. You might also want to customize the JSP that generated the
                    actual RSS XML.

            <subsection name="Using your own document type">
                <p>
                    To use your own document type in an RSS feed, check the following:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Make sure your document type has title, date and description fields.
                            You can give the fields any name you want, they will be mapped later
                            to bean properties.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Enter the full JCR node type name (e.g. "myproject:mydoctype") of your document type
                            in the "Document Type" field of your RSS feed descriptor document.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Create a Java bean for your document type. You probably already
                            have it if you are building an HST2 website. Check out
                            <a href="http://forge.onehippo.org/svn/rss/trunk/rss-hst-component/src/main/java/org/onehippo/forge/rss/beans/SampleRSSItem.java">SampleRSSItem.java</a>
                            for an example. It is best to have getTitle(), getDate() and getDescription()
                            methods, so you won't have to change the RSSFeedBuilder HST component class.
                            But if you really want you can use other method names to get your
                            title, date and description fields.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            The RSSFeedBuilder HST components currently has a limitation: it has the name
                            of the date field hardcoded in its search filter (see <a href="http://forge.onehippo.org/tracker/index.php?func=detail&amp;aid=29&amp;group_id=29&amp;atid=198">bug #29</a>). Open
                            <a href="http://forge.onehippo.org/svn/rss/trunk/rss-hst-component/src/main/java/org/onehippo/forge/rss/components/RSSFeedBuilder.java">RSSFeedBuilder.java</a>
                            and replace "rss:date" with the full JCR property name of your document type's
                            date field.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </subsection>
            <subsection name="Customizing the RSS XML">
                <p>
                    If you want to modify the actual RSS XML, edit the file <a href="downloads/jsp/rss.jsp">rss.jsp</a>
                    in your site module.
