                <p>
                    <b>RSS Feed Creator</b> is an addon for Hippo CMS that lets you create
                    <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">RSS feeds</a>
                    from within the CMS. You can create as many feeds as you like, and for each
                    feed you can setup filters to determine which documents to include.
                </p>
                <p>
                    RSS Feed Creator includes an RSS Feed document type for Hippo CMS, and
                    an HST component that you can drop in your HST website to display the
                    feeds you created.
