          <b>Feed Creator</b>
          is an addon for Hippo CMS that lets you create
          <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">RSS feeds</a>,
          <a href="http://www.atomenabled.org/developers/syndication/atom-format-spec.php">ATOM feeds</a>
          and  provides an API which enables you to create your own web syndications
          with the CMS. You can create as many feeds as you like, and for each
          feed you can setup filters to determine which documents to include.
